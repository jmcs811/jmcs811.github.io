You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

Popular Movies is an Android application I made while participating in Udacity's Android course. This was the first application I made by my self. I learned a lot about the Android framework and APIs. I also used JSON and REST API for the first time. The application isn't too complicated, but it I learned a lot making it. It can be downloaded on the Google Play store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jcaseydev.popularmovies">here</a>
