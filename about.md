I am a computer science student currently studying at the University of Maryland Global Campus. I like building software and solving complex problems. I have the most expirence with Java but I have used Python, C, and x86 assembly to name a few others. I enjoy leanrning about Android development and building appications. I am hoping to start a career as a software engineer upon graduating.
